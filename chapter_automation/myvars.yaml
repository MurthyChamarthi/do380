## NOTE: We can run off of the vanilla OCP 4.3 cluster. I just went through and chose the variables that seem potentially relevant to us.

## Need bastion host, but not sure if backpack makes this obsolete
install_bastion: true

install_ocp4: true
ocp4_installer_version: '4.3.X'

## Will need this injected into our docs for users to know where to log into
cluster_name: "cluster-{{ guid }}"

## SSH Keys
#env_authorized_key: bt-key
#ansible_ssh_private_key_file: '~/.ssh/{{ key_name }}'
## ended up using ssh password for testing
